				<div>
<div>
<p>I think a lot about the  place of desire. An incorrect relationship to desire, I believe, has got  us in this mess. Certainly an incorrect relationship to desire has  often got me in a mess!</p>
<p>On the other hand, I don&#39;t believe desires are meant to be eradicated. Desires are part of the grand scheme.</p>
<p>The  problem comes, however, when mistake desires for the grand scheme. As  though desires are the be all and end all. They are not. They are indeed  part of the grand scheme. But they are only a part.</p>
<p>The  middle way, I think--the challenge--is to find a way to align our  desires with the needs of the world. So that the two come together.</p>
<p>If we can do this, then we help ourselves to help the world and help the world to help ourselves.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Here is a note I just sent out to friends and since you are my friend, too:</p>
<p>Hi Folks--</p>
<p>Sorry  for group email. I&#39;m just writing to a group of  friends who have, at  one time or another, expressed interest in my Zen  school.</p>
<p>This  Friday, April 15, we have a very unusual event  happening. Zen Master  Soeng Hyang (Bobby Rhodes), who is the guiding  teacher of the entire  Kwan Um School of Zen, will be visiting and giving  a dharma talk along  side our resident NYC Zen Master Wu Kwang (Richard  Shrobe).</p>
<p>Bobby  has a charismatic every day feel and Richard is very deeply  steeped in  Buddhist history and tradition (he has authored several  compelling  books on Zen). The combination of the two of them will be  amazing  (their bios are below the sign off).</p>
<p>[UPDATE: It turns out that ZM Soeng Hyang has been detained by the untimely death of a dharma brother and so won&#39;t be there. But the inimitable ZM Wu Kwang will be. So come just the same!]</p>
<p>I certainly will be  there and I hope you can come too. The talk  starts at 7:45 PM on Friday  and is at 400 E 14th St, Apt 2D/E (just east  of 1st Ave). Don&#39;t be  confused: the building offers no outward  appearance that there is a Zen  center inside, but there is!</p>
<p>Hope to see you there!</p>
<p>All the best,</p>
<p>Colin</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Zen  Master Soeng Hyang (Barbara Rhodes) is the School Zen Master and   Guiding Dharma Teacher of the Kwan Um School of Zen. She received dharma   transmission from Zen Master Seung Sahn on October 10, 1992. She was   one of Zen Master Seung Sahn&#39;s first American students and studied with   him since 1972. She was given inka in 1977. A registered nurse since   1969, she works for Hospice Care of Rhode Island. She helped found   Providence Zen Center, and lived there for seventeen years, serving in a   number of administrative capacities. Zen Master Soeng Hyang has a   daughter and lives with her partner, Mary, in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Zen  Master Wu Kwang, (Richard Shrobe) is guiding teacher of the Chogye   International Zen Center of New York and lives in New York with his   family. Before he began practicing Zen he studied intensively with Swami   Satchidananda, living with his wife and children for four years at the   Integral Yoga Institute in New York. He has a Master’s degree in  Social  Work and did six years of postgraduate study in Gestalt,  including  training with Laura Perls. He has been director of a drug  program, and  has served as an instructor in psychiatry and Gestalt  therapy. He  started practicing with Zen Master Seung Sahn in 1975 and  was given inka  in 1984. He received dharma transmission on August 1,  1993. A former  professional musician, his undergraduate training was in  music theory,  and he also studied with jazz pianist, Barry Harris.  Currently he has a  private practice in psychotherapy specializing in  the Gestalt approach.  He has written three books: <em>Open Mouth Already a Mistake</em>, <em>Don’t Know Mind: The Spirit of Korean Zen</em>, and <em>Elegant Failure: A Guide to Zen Koans</em>, all available from from Amazon.com.</p>

				<p>Hi Folks--</p>
<p>Just a little news about the <a href="http://bit.ly/NIPprogramassociate" target="_self">No Impact Project</a>,  the non-profit effort I started to help people to become engaged  citizens through both lifestyle change and community and national  political involvement (from both sides of the aisle).</p>
<p>1. We are looking for a program associate. The job description is below and on <a href="http://bit.ly/NIPprogramassociate" target="_self">Idealist</a>. Please follow directions below to apply.</p>
<p>2. We are also always looking for interns and volunteers. The type of work we have includes elements of what is in the job description below. People who help out are often able to get credits from their college or a good resume boost. If you&#39;re interested, please send your resume to lindsay@noimpactproject.org.</p>
<p>Program Associate at the No Impact Project</p>
<p>The No Impact Project is looking for a New York City based, talented and motivated college  graduate with two to five years work experience in event production,  fund raising and/or non-profit management. This is a 20 to 30 hour a  week position that could ultimately become full time. You will work  closely with and report to Colin Beavan (aka No Impact Man) to raise funds, execute program logistics,  and help to build interest in  all of our programs  including No Impact Weeks, our Eco Leadership  retreats and more.</p>
<p>The No Impact Project was founded in 2009 by  Colin Beavan (No Impact Man), following the success of his blog, book,  and Sundance-selected film, which chronicle his experiment in living a  zero-waste lifestyle in New York City. We have reached millions of  people with our programs, including the No Impact Week, an engaging and  fun weeklong carbon cleanse that gives participants the opportunity to  experience a low impact living experiment of their own.</p>
<p>Program Associate Duties and Responsibilities</p>
<p>This is an excellent position for someone with great organizational,  administrative, communication and writing skills who likes the idea of  working independently and having a lot of responsibility early in their  career.</p>
<p>The No Impact Project takes a fun, love-filled, and slightly  unconventional approach to its work and its mission. We partner  regularly with much larger environmental organizations so you would have  frequent interaction with other parts of the non-profit world.</p>
<p>Because we are small, we have the flexibility to try new things as  long as they fulfill our mission and are fulfilling to all involved. We  are not a bricks and mortar organization. We work from our homes,  cafes and other pleasant meeting places and stay in regular contact by  phone, Skype and regular meetings.</p>
<p>Our mission is to combine various forms of media and entertainment  with educational programs in order to engage regular citizens in the  quest for a way of life that is both better for people and better for  the planet. Our methodology is to move people along a path from passive  concern, to personal/lifestyle change to community and political  engagement (from both sides of the aisle).</p>
<p>Areas of responsibility will include:<br />●     Program-related research, development, and execution<br />●     Communications and marketing<br />●     Event planning<br />●     Grant proposal research and writing<br />●     Social media and technology project development<br />●     Administrative duties</p>
<p>Qualifications:<br />●     College graduate<br />●     Resident of New York City or surrounding area<br />●     Excellent writing and communications skills<br />●     Strong interpersonal skills<br />●     Previous experience in event planning or program management<br />●     Highly organized and detail oriented<br />●     Interest in environmental and sustainability issues<br />●     Ability to work independently and take initiative<br />●    Confident, good sense of humor, creative thinker (all requirements!)</p>
<p>As most of our work is done via telephone and internet, the position  is mostly virtual. It will begin as a part time consultant, with the  potential to become full time staff. We are looking to start the Program Associate immediately. Applications are due by April 18th, 2011.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Hi folks, I wanted to share an email I got from my friend Bill McKibben, leader of 350.org.</p>
<p>In it, he explains how the Chamber of Commerce is injecting huge amounts of cash into American politics and blocking action on climate. He says that the Chamber claims to represent all of American business. So he has started a petition of businesses who don&#39;t support the Chamber&#39;s position to show that what the Chamber says about representing American business is not true. If you own a business, why not join in?</p>
<p>But go ahead and read the letter for yourself:</p>
<p><em>Dear Friends,</em><br /> <br /><em> People have been asking me: of all the potential targets on the planet, why is <a href="http://350.org/" target="_blank">350.org</a> taking on the US Chamber of Commerce?&#0160;</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Simply put, the US Chamber is one of the biggest barriers to climate progress in the entire world. </strong></em><br /> <br /><em> In the last year for which statistics are available, the US  Chamber spent five times as much money lobbying as the next highest  spender -- Exxon Mobil. They spent more money on political campaigning  than the Republican and Democratic national committees. And they used  all that corporate cash to make sure that the planet kept warming,  opposing almost every measure that might have made even a small  difference. Not to worry, they told the EPA: when the earth warmed,  humans could “adapt their physiologies.”</em><br /> <br /><em> That’s why we’re taking them on. And if you think that they’re  too powerful to hurt, you’re both right and wrong. We can’t take away  their money -- the Supreme Court has seen to that with the Citizens  United decision -- but we can neutralize their other major source of  power, the claim that they “represent American business.” They don’t:  most American businesses aren’t like the handful of giant corporations  that provide most of the Chamber’s funds. We should be clear: the US  Chamber isn&#39;t a government agency, it&#39;s a privately controlled front  group for big corporations. </em><br /> <br /><em> We’ve got amazing momentum for the campaign already: from Arroyo  Veterinary Hospital to Zero Gravity Marketing, over 1,000 businesses  have already said they don’t need the Chamber claiming to represent them  on energy and climate. But the Chamber claims it has 300,000 members.  So we have 299,000 to go to catch up. We can do it -- you could easily  sign up ten businesses yourself in the next week. </em><br /> <br /><em> <strong>If just 500 people commit to getting 10 businesses on board  this week, we’ll blow past the 5,000 business mark in the next few days. </strong><strong><a href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=iA%2F%2BwGJm60sXPjH3V7UGToFVeP3Iwkj8" target="_blank">Click here to join in. </a></strong></em><br /> <br /><em> When you’re shopping, going to the gym, renewing your insurance,  or getting your hair cut: ask to speak to the owner. Go over the simple  talking points we&#39;ve written up, and get them to sign the pledge -- and  if you’re handy with the camera on your phone, get them to make a short  video. (The best ones show the boss at work as she talks -- the barber  with scissors in hand, for example). Hell, you probably have ten friends who run small businesses of their own. </em><br /> <br /><em> I know that this doesn’t sound dramatic. Compared to the  remarkable bravery folks are showing in Egypt and Libya (or the  leadership closer to home of our friends <a href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=Nt2zmTTtd%2F%2FT3Z7vfnnMlYFVeP3Iwkj8" target="_blank">Tim DeChristopher</a> and <a href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=Z9OPdHz4E2vVyhDn2jWIQoFVeP3Iwkj8" target="_blank">Wendell Berry</a>) this is easy -- you just need guts enough to talk to the guy behind the counter. </em><br /> <br /><em> There will be more chances for dramatic action as the year goes on—<a href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=%2FVVb%2FhP9F5d1ge4dlyTKkoFVeP3Iwkj8" target="_blank">here&#39;s our latest thinking on the growing opportunities for civil disobedience</a>, for example.&#0160; But you don’t need to go to jail to make a difference -- sometimes small actions truly do add up. </em><br /> <br /><em> If you’re sick of the power of big money in our lives, then now’s the moment to do your part.</em><br /> <br /><em> <strong>Again, all you need to know to sign up businesses is </strong><a href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=Fh%2FkQaRrJKmoNGBKYxYTQIFVeP3Iwkj8" target="_blank"><strong>right here.</strong></a> It’s really easy and it’s also really important.</em></p>
<p><em>Onwards,</em><br /> <br /><em> Bill McKibben for <a href="http://350.org/" target="_blank">350.org</a></em><br /> <br /><em> P.S. How do we know we’re getting nearer to the real centers of power? Because they’re fighting back. Read the story of <a href="http://350.org/" target="_blank">350.org</a>, the Red Sox, and how Glenn Beck accused me of being a communist <a href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=EeWioHYUwbNNz6f%2FudtGWoFVeP3Iwkj8" target="_blank">right here. </a></em></p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="http://noimpactman.typepad.com/blog/2011/02/advice-from-an-accidental-activist.html">Advice from an Accidental Activist</a></h3>
		
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><em>The following article was originally published in </em>Yes! Magazine <em>at <a href="http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/can-animals-save-us/colin-beavan-advice-from-an-accidental-activist" target="_self">this location</a>. Other articles I&#39;ve published in </em>Yes! <em>include: &quot;<a href="http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/climate-action/10-ways-to-change-your-life" target="_self">Ten Ways to Change Your Life</a>,&quot; &quot;<a href="http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/climate-action/fight-climate-change-live-the-good-life" target="_self">Fight Climate Change: Live the Good Life</a>,&quot; and &quot;<a href="http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/sustainable-happiness/christmas-with-no-presents" target="_self">Christmas with No Presents</a>.&quot;</em></p>
<p>So many of us have good ideas for helping the world. But we tuck our  ideas away. I did. I’d tell myself that if the idea were any good  someone else would have already done it. That I’m not capable of making a  difference. I’d sit on my ideas, get on with my “life,” and then feel  angry at the world because the problems I cared about didn’t get solved.</p>
<p>I had that fear of going first.</p>
<p>Then I took my first hapless step into what I call accidental  activism. In 2006, I started a project where I lived as environmentally  as possible for a year—with my little family, on the ninth floor of an  apartment building in the middle of New York City—to attract attention  to the world’s environmental, economic, and quality of life crises.</p>
<p>I had no experience as an activist. Yet suddenly <a href="http://www.yesmagazine.org/planet/colin-beavan-help-me-build-a-better-future" title="Colin Beavan: Help Me Build a Better Future">my project caught fire</a>.</p>
<p>My book and film, both titled <em><a href="http://www.yesmagazine.org/multimedia/yes-video/no-impact-man-trailer" title="No Impact Man Movie Trailer">No Impact Man</a></em>,  ended up being translated into 20-plus languages. Some philanthropists  appeared and offered me funding to hire consultants to get  NoImpactProject.org off the ground. About 20,000 people have now  participated in our educational immersion program, No Impact Week.</p>
<p>And how have I felt through all this?</p>
<p>Like a deer in the headlights.</p>
<p>How am I supposed to stand up to all this? Surely people can see how  selfish and shortsighted I am? That I’m sometimes mean to my family?  People like me aren’t supposed to do things like this. We’re supposed to  wait for people who have their acts together, and follow them.</p>
<p>But if we wait for those people, we’re done for.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people who know way more about activism and  citizen engagement than me. I’m pretty ordinary. Frankly, I don’t even  always want to be of service. But I’ve now learned a lot about how to be  an ordinary person, filled with self-doubt, who still takes the risk of  trying to do something about the world. Maybe you’re like me. And maybe  the things that have helped me will help you, too.</p>
<h3>Be Stupid Enough to Take The First Step</h3>
<p>My first step was just to begin living with the lowest possible  environmental impact. A few people said I was “too stupid to know that  one person can’t make a difference.” Think on this story (with apologies  for high schmaltz quotient):</p>
<p>Two frogs—one very smart and one very stupid—are caught in a bowl of  cream. The sides are too steep to climb and they have no foothold to  jump. The stupid one begins to swim as hard and fast as he can. The  smart one looks over and says to himself, “He’s too stupid to know that  all that effort will make no difference.”</p>
<p>Having weighed the hopelessness of the situation, the smart one  decides that the most intelligent thing is to give up. So—Blub!—he  drowns. The stupid one keeps trying. Just when his legs are about to  give out the cream starts to get thicker. His struggling has churned the  cream to butter. He’s surprised to find himself on solid ground. He  jumps out. By stupidly pursuing the first step (swimming), the second  step (jumping out) appeared, as if by magic.</p>
<p>The question is not whether you can make a difference. The question  is, do you want to be the person who tries? Do you want to be like the  smart frog, who relies on the brain that tells him there is no solution,  or the stupid frog, whose heart tells him to try anyway?</p>
<p>Maybe you care about food deserts and kids not having access to good  food, or maybe it’s incarceration of local youth, or maybe, like me, you  worry about inaction on climate change. Whatever it is, pick up your  placard or call your senator or gather your friends. Don’t worry about  the second step. Just be too stupid to know the first step won’t work.</p>
<h3>Use Your Personal Story to Inspire a Movement</h3>
<p>Part of the reason one person can make a difference is that one  person’s efforts soon inspire other people’s efforts. So inspire other  people to get involved by sharing your personal story. Not just the  story, say, of the hungry children in the Global South who you are  trying to help, but your own story.</p>
<p>In No Impact Man, I share stories of how I tried to keep my food  fresh without a refrigerator, how I had to eat mostly cabbage in the  winter, and how I washed my laundry by hand. People didn’t suddenly  realize that they, too, should hand-wash their clothes. Instead, they  learned, not that they should make a difference—which statistics and  figures tell us—but that they can make a difference—which personal  stories have the power to tell.</p>
<p>It is through the personal that people connect with the political.</p>
<p>No matter what your cause, look for the powerful, personal story  about how you got involved and how being involved has improved your life  in some way. I’ve heard it said we shouldn’t have to tell these  stories—that people should automatically care. The thing is, once they  know, people do care. The problem is that they are often overwhelmed by  it. So the job is not to shove information at them that makes them feel  guilty for not doing something. The job is to give them a story that  shows them how to do something.</p>
<h3>Get Off the Internet and Into Real Life</h3>
<p>Back in the ’60s, a string of civil rights sit-ins began when four  students from a black college in North Carolina sat down at a  whites-only Woolworth lunch counter. In the end, about 70,000 students  participated in sit-ins that spread across the state. As Malcolm  Gladwell points out in a recent New Yorker article, the action didn’t  start with lots of Twitter followers. It started with lots of  flesh-and-blood (as opposed to Facebook) friends.</p>
<p>The strong social bonds and long-standing mutual trust gave those  first four students the bravery to stand up for themselves. Gladwell  says that the strong ties of real friendship and community—not the weak  ties of the virtual world—are necessary to make us feel supported enough  to take meaningful risks for our values.</p>
<p>I ran a blog at <a href="http://www.noimpactman.com/">NoImpactMan.com</a> and many thousands of people came there to discuss their views on and  methods of environmental living. It was a good thing. In the absence of  real-life communities of shared environmental values, the blog provided a  lot of people with some measure of community support. But the stronger,  more action-oriented communities are formed in my work when people come  together for our No Impact Weeks.</p>
<p>One of the most accomplished friendship-based communities I am  familiar with, 350.org, the grassroots climate organization, began with a  group of students who lived together at college and then in the Bay  Area. They have grown their little house party into an international  organization of hundreds of thousands of climate activists. They use the  Web to aggregate the actions of thousands of friendship-based groups.  But the point is the actions taken by small communities of friends or  neighbors—not the information sharing.</p>
<p>So use the Internet, of course. But use it to get people to do things  in real life. What if the many hours spent leaving angry comments on  the Huffington Post were instead spent gathering once a week in a coffee  shop. Sooner or later, real action—as opposed to real, um, clicks—might  occur. Get people to come together. They need each other.</p>
<h3>Trust Your Vision</h3>
<p>So you have your idea, you’ve taken your first step, you’ve gathered  like-minded people, and now you have a little bit of energy and success.  Great news! This is when the critics and second-guessers arrive. That’s  a reason for not getting started in the first place, right? Nobody  bothers to second-guess you when you’re just fantasizing about your  great idea.<br />I suddenly found myself invited to go on Good Morning  America with Diane Sawyer. As they say: WTF? I was horrified. I’m sure I  had an overinflated sense of my own importance, but I was worried I  could send people in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>I had no real endorsement other than—again—my own trust in my  intentions. I had to go on national television trusting in myself and my  vision.</p>
<p>Absolutely the hardest thing of all was this: I had to accept that I might be wrong and do it anyway.</p>
<p>Sadly, lots of arguments break out in activist communities about best  methods. People tear each other apart as though the scenario is  either/or when really it’s and/also. We need many shoulders against many  doors. What I’ve learned as I’ve come to meet so many amazing engaged  citizens is that it takes many different strategies and many different  styles to make the changes we’re hoping for.</p>
<p>So trust your vision. You may find that the biggest sacrifice you can  make for the world is to face the possibility of being publicly wrong.  And to move forward anyway.</p>
<h3>Take Care of Yourself</h3>
<p>Once you get involved in this kind of work, the pressures mount—many  of them from within rather than without. We need to take care of both  the insides and the outsides. I started by saying you just need to take  the first step, but this step is just as important. If you can’t sustain  yourself, you can’t sustain your work.</p>
<p>No Impact Man, in many ways, began as an extension of my meditation  practice. A lot of the confidence I needed came from inklings of  understanding of the Truth—whatever the hell that is. And of Service.  But while I was making time for TV appearances and press interviews and  rallies and favors and guest appearances on blogs I lost time for my  meditation.</p>
<p>Then anxiety arrived. And depression. I was running on fumes. I was  draining the battery without charging it. The good news is that I am  back to my regular practice. I feel better. Of course, I’m not saying  you should necessarily meditate, just that you need to find what suits  you to take care of your insides.</p>
<p>About the outsides: A couple of years ago, after so many TV  interviews and radio interviews and international press appearances  (and, by the way, repeatedly having to face accusers who said I was  trying to get rich from the world’s problems), I looked at my bank  balance and saw I had about $200 left—about $3,000 less than my monthly  nut. I’d been working all my waking hours on what I believed in and  couldn’t take care of myself.Luckily for me, I didn’t have to change  much (like, I began to ask to get paid when someone asked me to make a  speech) but I did have to face my guilt and confront my monkish  self-image. There is a meme in our culture: You can be a monk or a  merchant. Monks do good and merchants make money. If you make any  money—if you find a way to take care of your outsides—you can’t be an  ascetic monk, and you’re not really doing good.</p>
<p>Imagine, though, if we create a new meme. What if we show each other  how wonderfully well we’re managing as a result of taking our ideas for  social change and running with them? What if we bragged about  outperforming the bankers every so often?</p>
<p>But even if we don’t get the chance to do that, we should at least  make good homes out of our lives. Without loving ourselves, the love for  others will wither. By taking the burden of the world on our shoulders,  we leave no room for the strength of others. In other words, have fun!</p>
<p>After all, the world isn’t worth saving if there isn’t time for joking around.</p>
<p>Besides, we might as well enjoy ourselves when you realize how much  work there is to get done. With two wars in progress, melting ice caps,  and an economic system teetering on the brink of collapse, there just  isn’t time to wait for some guru or leader to give us permission to act  on our good ideas.</p>
<p>Who’s going to fix things if it isn’t us? I can’t help thinking that  the time has come for us to take back our culture. It’s time for every  citizen with a good idea to get to work, to trust yourself, to start.  Sooner or later you have to accept the fact that you need no other  authority than your good intentions and your loving heart.</p>

				<p>Please share this note widely with all your friends and ask them to go to this is an article by me in the Daily News (<a href="http://nydn.us/dOW8rH" target="_self">http://nydn.us/dOW8rH</a>)  and leave their comments. Better yet, if you are a New Yorker, please void a letter to the News editor (directions below).</p>
<p>Bike lanes, as you know, make people healthier, neighborhoods nicer  and the planet happier. More bike lanes in NYC--since it sets  trends--will mean more bike lanes around the world.</p>
<p>One simple way to help support bikes lanes in NYC is to leave  comments of support on the Daily News page where the article is. So  please do so.</p>
<p>To do one better,void a letter to the Daily News editor (see  directions below), especially if you&#39;re from NYC, saying that you agree  with my article and that you wholeheartedly support Sadik-Khan and  Bloomberg&#39;s bike lane program.</p>
<p>Even if your letter is not printed, you will help convince the Daily  News editorial board to get behind the bike lane program. This is a case  where writing a letter really can make a difference.</p>
<p>If you leave a comment void a letter (or better yet, do both)  please leave a comment here to let us all know. Perhaps, if you can,  leave the link to your comment so we can all give you props!</p>
<p>Directions for writing letter to Daily News editor:</p>

This Program Manager will be vital in helping us  build capacity in our organization and continue to develop and manage  our programs.</p>
<p>The No Impact Project was founded in 2009 by Colin Beavan (No Impact  Man), following the success of his blog, book, and Sundance-selected  film, which chronicle his experiment living a zero-waste lifestyle in  New York City. Our goal is to empower citizens to make choices which  better their lives and lower their environmental impact through  lifestyle change, community action, and participation in civic  engagement. We have reached millions of people with our programs,  including the No Impact Week, an engaging and fun weeklong carbon  cleanse that gives participants the opportunity to experience a low  impact living experiment of their own.</p>
<p>Areas of responsibility will include:</p>
<p>●     Program-related research, development, and execution</p>
<p>●     Communications and marketing</p>
<p>●     Event planning</p>
<p>●     Grant proposal research and writing</p>
<p>●     Social media and technology project development</p>
<p>●     Administrative duties</p>
<p>Qualifications:</p>
<p>●     College graduate</p>
<p>●     Resident of New York City or surrounding area</p>

				<p>Yesterday, President Obama, speaking in Tucson, Arizona in the wake of the recent shootings, said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“At a time when our discourse has become so sharply polarized, at a time  when we are far too eager to lay the blame for all that ails the world  at the feet of those who think differently than we do, it’s  important for us to pause for a moment and make sure that we are talking  with each other in a way that heals, not a way that wounds.”</p>
<p>I have to be careful when I hear words like these. Because when I hear them, I might automatically nod my head and think, &quot;Yes, the people who disagree with me should be more civil.&quot; But this isn&#39;t about other people.</p>
<p>It&#39;s about me, the only person I can do anything about. I can help end partisanship by making sure that <em>I</em> talk in a way that that heals.</p>
<p>If I want to help the world, what I have to remember is that this is about my conduct. It&#39;s about me.</p>

				<p><strong><a href="http://www.yesmagazine.org/planet/join-yes-for-no-impact-week" title="Join YES! for No Impact Week"><strong>Sign  up today for No Impact Week, kicking off January 2nd with YES!</strong></a></strong></p>
<p>When we at the <a href="http://noimpactproject.org/2010/01/no-impact-week-registration/">No  Impact Project</a> first launched our immersion program in extreme environmental living—<a href="http://www.yesmagazine.org/planet/join-yes-for-no-impact-week" title="Join YES!  for No Impact Week">No  Impact Week</a>—I didn&#39;t dream that more than 15,000 people would participate in only a year and a  half. After all, we’ re not talking about 15,000 people taking a couple of hours out  of their day to attend a political rally or protest environmental issues.  We are talking about 15,000 people who have taken an entire week out of their  lives to experiment with socially and environmentally responsible lifestyles.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of people taking on a big commitment. It’s a lot of people with big hearts, who care about how we live and are  questing for a better life. It’s humbling how many individuals around the world truly  want to take responsibility for our planet’ s problems and find a better way  to live—a way based on human values rather than economic ones.</p>
<p>No Impact Week participants join <a href="http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/climate-solutions/communities-in-transition" title="Communities in Transition">Transition  Towns</a>, <a href="http://www.yesmagazine.org/planet/reaching-for-resilience" title="Reaching for Resilience">eco-villages</a>,  <a href="http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/go-local" title="Go Local!">local business</a> and  <a href="http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/food-for-everyone" title="Food for Everyone">food  initiatives</a>, and <a href="http://www.yesmagazine.org/blogs/sarah-van-gelder/pioneers-of-the-new-normal" title="Pioneers of the New Normal">countless  others</a> in a <a href="http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/what-happy-families-know/change-comes-from-you-and-me" title="Change Comes From You and Me">growing  movement toward happier, healthier lives</a>.</p>
<p>These are people who understand that all of us are in the throes of a huge crisis, and also that this crisis provides a wonderful opportunity—a wake up call—to ask what actually makes a good life.  Proponents of this movement perceive that the truly good life and the life that  preserves the habitat we depend upon for our health, happiness and security are  one and the same.</p>
<p>We are not short on major problems. We have war, climate change, political divisiveness, and over-stressed ecological systems,  and we teeter dangerously close to economic collapse. Americans (and even some  Europeans) suffer from depression and anxiety disorders in epidemic proportions.  And that’s just in the developed economies. In the Global South, one billion people  don’t even have access to clean drinking water. What&#39;s more, it is clear that  the way of life behind many of these symptoms is not making us as happy  as we might be. If it’s not making us happy, then what are we trashing the planet for?</p>
<p>There has to be a better way, and millions of us know it.</p>
<p>That’s one reason why No Impact Week has attracted so many  participants. It is an opportunity for people to retreat from consumerism and ask themselves  what their lives are really about. It’s a chance for each of us to strip away the  bling from our lives and look for the true substance. What is actually  important to us? What is most precious about being human? And how much do we really  attend to that?</p>
<p>These used to be philosophical questions. But with dwindling  planetary resources, they have become practical: As these resources become less  abundant and more expensive, we must be sure that we are using them in ways that are in line with a purposeful  way of life.</p>
<p>No Impact Week gives people a chance to confront these questions and  share honest answers—which is why I am so happy that readers of YES! Magazine  are taking up the challenge to join in. The week will be frustrating at  times and joyful at others, but the point is to learn—to learn what kind of lives  we really want for ourselves and our communities, to what extent the  economic system permits these best lives, and how we can step up with kindness  and love to do what is needed.</p>
<p>For some of us, this is an overwhelming task. We wonder if anything we do can make a difference at all. But ultimately, this  stumbling block misses the point: The real question is whether we can live our own  lives embracing the values we hold most dear. History proves the immense power  of social change when individuals choose to live according to their values,  participating in what they believe in and turning away from what they don’t.</p>
<p>In the words of Ghandi, whose vision of the transformative power of  non-violence is very much present in our own hopes for a healthy,  holistic, and happy society:</p>
<p>“The world of tomorrow will be, must be, a society based on  non-violence. It may seem a distant goal, an unpractical utopia. But it is not in the  least unobtainable, since it can be worked from here and now. An individual  can adopt the way of life of the future—the non-violent way—without having to wait  for others to do so. And if an individual can do it, cannot whole groups of individuals? Whole <a name="_GoBack"></a>nations? Men often hesitate to  make a beginning because they feel that the objective cannot be achieved in its entirety. This attitude of mind is precisely our greatest obstacle to progress—an obstacle that each man, if he only will it, can clear away.”</p>
<p>I look forward to the time when all of us have the courage and the  faith to “will it.”</p>
<p>With love,<br /> Colin Beavan aka No Impact Man</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>In 2006, I became increasingly concerned both about climate change and the military action taken by the United States to secure its access to oil supplies in the Middle East.</p>
<p>As a journalist and author, I wanted to find a way to make the case for a lower reliance on fossil fuels and other natural resources to the American and European publics. &#0160;</p>
<p>However, I did not believe a typical political discourse would not do the trick. There had been many of such books already written that attempted such a discourse.</p>
<p>Instead, I wanted to find a way to engage Americans who were not typically interested in politics. For this reason, I wanted to draw people in through the power of story instead of polemic.&#0160;</p>
<p>The story I chose was one about my family--family is something people care about in the United States. Indeed, &quot;family values&quot; are often discussed by conservative Americans, many of whom oppose action on climate change.&#0160;</p>
<p>As the story goes, for one year, we lived, in the middle of New York City, causing as little environmental impact as possible.&#0160;  This meant, not making any trash, not using any fossil fuel transportation, buying local food, not purchasing anything new. Etc etc.</p>
<p>This experiment in environmental lifestyle was discussed in my blog, my book, and a documentary movie, all by the title No Impact Man.  My hope was that the story of, if you like, That Crazy Family in New York City would attract attention to our climate crisis.</p>
<p>It was successful beyond my wildest dreams. In 2007, the New York Times wrote a front page story on the No Impact Man project. It has been covered in major newspapers and television channels across the world.  There have been over 3 million unique visitors to the blog. The book has been translated into some 15 languages and has sold more than 50,000 copies in the United States alone.&#0160;</p>
<p>The movie has been released in theaters in the United States and other countries around the world. In addition, there have been over 1,000 community screenings around the world to groups ranging in size from 20 to 500 people. I have been invited to discuss No Impact Man with college audiences totalling some 15,000 in number over the last three months.</p>
<p>Also, some 15,000 world citizens have participated in a program run by my non-profit, the No Impact Project. In this, participants try themselves to live with as low a carbon footprint as possible for a whole week.  This is not 15,000 people turning out for a two hour protest. It is 15,000 people devote themselves to significant hardship for an entire week.&#0160;</p>
<p>I like to think that this shows that, when they understand the connection of climate to their own lives, people are willing to dedicate substantial effort. This is very heartening. &#0160;</p>
<p>But I have a caution.&#0160;A Google search for the phrase No Impact Man yields some 470,000 unique results. Meanwhile, a Google search for the phrase Cop 16 yields 500,000 unique results. In other words, about the same. &#0160;</p>
<p>Of course, I don&#39;t cite these figures to suggest that No Impact Man compares in importance to Cop 16.&#0160;  I say this to show that something as important as Cop 16, which I believe is part of a process of literally saving our species, does not get discussed by the public just because it is important. In fact, it&#39;s importance gets dwarfed by &quot;better stories.&quot;</p>
<p>Just because you and I consider something vastly important doesn&#39;t mean everyone else will. Especially if they don&#39;t really understand it.</p>
<p>So how do we create &quot;better stories&quot;?</p>
<p>One method, I believe, is to find ways of creating real, human narratives that connect the life of the average global citizen to the complex and seemingly abstract problem of climate change.</p>
<p>In other words, can we find a way to talk about climate that isn&#39;t about climate? Instead, can we talk climate in a way that is about people?</p>
<p>It is my thinking that the reason why my small project has received so much attention is because, through discussing lifestyle, people are able to understand the connection between their own lives and climate. Suddenly, they understand why it is relevant to them.</p>
<p>On the subject of engaging citizens in this discussion about climate change, I&#39;d like to offer some conclusions I&#39;ve drawn through my experience as No Impact Man. I don&#39;t mean to imply that this is the way everyone should approach communicating on climate.</p>
<p>Instead, it is a list of guidelines I have developed for myself as travel around and talk void about climate to, I like to think, some success:</p>
<p>1. How to communicate about climate change is not a case of either/or but of and/also. Selling solutions to climates change is not like selling laundry soap. You can&#39;t figure out one message for the center of the bell curve. The message must be segmented. We have to communicate with the tails of the bell curve. Don&#39;t assume that everyone else will care for the same reasons you do.</p>
<p>2. No matter which community you are talking to, find a way to connect to their health, happiness and security. Mom&#39;s in DC may well want the coal-fired power plant removed, but not because of climate change. Instead, they want to get rid of it because it gives their children asthma.</p>
<p>3. Break away from dry scientific stories and find sympathetic human stories that connect to people&#39;s daily lives. In the United States, this is particularly important because Americans are ambivalent about politics. Our culture is one that concentrates more on individuals.</p>
<p>4. Don&#39;t speak about the planet. Speak about the habitat that we depend upon for our health, happiness and security. The planet is something else. The habitat is the air we breathe and the food we eat. When speaking about species extinction, point out that if the habitat cannot support other species, that is a sign that it may soon not be able to support us, either.</p>
<p>5. For crying out loud, joke around. If we can&#39;t laugh, is the planet even worth saving?</p>
<p>6. Break away from morality and guilt. Most people are moral, even if they don&#39;t care about what we care about. Instead, figure out what your audience is concerned about and find a way to make climate change solutions appeal to their concerns.</p>
<p>7. Forget trying to frighten people. Frightening people about things they feel they can do nothing about just forces them to ignore you.</p>
<p>8. Avoid dissociating conservatives by cloying too closely to progressive language. We cannot &quot;win&quot; on climate change. A progressive government will soon lose to a conservative one. The culture must be transformed so that strengthening the habitat is a people concern, not just a progressive one.</p>
<p>9. Build coalitions around the solutions rather than the problems. There may be disagreement on climate change, but there is very little disagreement that reducing reliance on dwindling and unstable fossil fuel sources would be good. To many people, renewable energy is just plain &quot;cool.&quot; Use the Star Trek factor in your favor.</p>
<p>10. Talk about aspirations and ambitions rather than limitations. Climate may be a crisis but its solution provides many opportunities. Wouldn&#39;t it be better not to have to live in a traffic jam of automobiles and instead have a healthy, enjoyable, and safe transportation system?</p>
<p>11. Listen and engage. Don&#39;t lecture. Don&#39;t talk down. People want to be engaged and have the opportunity to discuss. They don&#39;t want to be trained or talked at. Find ways for people to take ownership of the issue by letting them be part of the solution.</p>
<p>12. At least in the developed economies, don&#39;t talk about how a sustainable society would be just economically efficient but also talk about how it could bring a more meaningful life, one based more on community and social connection rather than consumption.</p>
<p>13. Tell people how to help. Don&#39;t agitate people about something that they can&#39;t act upon. That only turns them off. In the United States during World War II, scrap drives to help the war effort were hugely important to morale because people felt involved.</p>
